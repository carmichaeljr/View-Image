# View-Image
A image viewer alias for PowerShell

After placing this file in a folder called WindowsPowerShell in your Documents folder, it will set the View-Picture alias every time you open PowerShell. The alias takes one parameter, the name or path to the image file that you want to display. When displaying, the command 'n' will go to the next image file in the directory, and 'p' will go to the previous. Pressing 'q' exits the popup and returns you to PowerShell.
